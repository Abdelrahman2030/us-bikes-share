# Project description

## What is bike share
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

<br> In this project, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

## The data set description
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

<br>Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
<br>End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
<br>Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
<br>Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
<br>End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
<br>User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
<br>Gender
<br>Birth Year

## Main objective of the project
Create an interactive program that lest's the user choose which city he wants to see its data and lets him filter the data set by day and month if he wanted.
<br>Then the program would calculate basic statistics about the data set (the most common month, number of subscribers, females or males, most common station, average trip duration, etc.).
<br>Then display all of these information for the user.
